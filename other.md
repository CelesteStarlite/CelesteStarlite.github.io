## Last Month's Highlighted VOD ##

12 Hour Birthday Donathon!! (April 11th, 2021)

My favorite stream I've ever done, all unedited! (I removed the breaks just so it could fit into a 12 hour youtube video orz)

## Latest Video ##

Destiny 2 Raid Highlights, which is my first edited video! I'm really excited to make more and hone my skills, but for now this video is something I'm really proud of. Even if you don't play Destiny, I think it is still enjoyable to watch so I hope you check it out!
