# About Me! #

Hi! My name is Celeste (she/her). I've found myself fascinated with creative writing even since I was little, and for years I've been thinking about where I can take it. Since then, I've taken the first small steps to bring that simple hobby into something truly special. Whether it's a short story, expressive poem, or free flowing essay, I find myself constantly putting pen to paper in effort to create something I'm proud of.

As I began to leave my comfort zone and put myself out there, I found myself streaming on Twitch. Despite my anxiety, I found a heartwarming community and found incredible support for it. Now, I'm now a VTuber, a streamers/video creator that is represented by a virtual model. Now, you can find me streaming multiple times a week playing games and cracking jokes with friends.

# Where can you find me? #

This is my Twitter. Here I post updates on just about everything I work on, so it's the best way to keep up to date with what I do, whether it be streaming, writing, or general life updates. Of course, I also like to mess around a lot, but if my goal is to make you smile then you can't expect me to be serious all the time! Either way, it's the best way to interact with me casually.

Here is my Twitch, where I stream myself playing games as a VTuber! It's a great way to interact with me and have some fun! It can be chill and it can be chaotic, but I hope it'll put a smile on your face! You can also check the [streams](other) section.
