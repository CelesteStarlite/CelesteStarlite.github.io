# Welcome to Celeste Starlite's Website! #
If you've stumbled on this site from the endless void of the internet, welcome! My name is Celeste, and I'm happy to present to you my portfolio! At least, I suppose. Part of me feels this is just a blog of sorts, but I'll try to make this something special so you can see the kind of things I do! If you don't know where I am, you can check the [About Me](about) section to see more of who I am.

If you've seen something from me before, whether it's a stream, a story, or even just a tweet, this is my hub for all that I do! Feel free to scroll around and see more of what I do. I'll be updating this place monthly with stories and clips, so it'll always be lively!

If you're a student that shares the same class as me and are confused, just know that you're seeing a whole new side of me you haven't before. Feel free to explore, but keep this between us okay~?
