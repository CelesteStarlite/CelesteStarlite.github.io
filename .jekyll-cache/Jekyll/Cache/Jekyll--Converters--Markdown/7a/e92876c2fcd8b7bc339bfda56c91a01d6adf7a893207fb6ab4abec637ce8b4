I"<p>Recently, I stumbled upon an old sheet of paper from years prior. It was a math assignment, but I couldn’t tell what year it was from. It looked like it was ripped from one of those workbooks we were given at the beginning of the year, well before we started getting textbooks that we’d solve problems from on lined paper. The lesson was on probability, but the thing that caught my eye was a handwritten chart, the pencil marks fading away on the thin paper. All it had was the 36 values that 2 6-sided dice could roll.</p>
