<p>A poem about negative voices</p>

<p>Turning on the shower<br />
Warm water spilling out onto the floor<br />
A lengthy sigh escapes into the scalding steam.<br />
In rhythmic tapping of drops on my back<br />
My eyes softly close as steam encircles me,<br />
And I sink to the floor underneath the water stream.</p>

<p>Sitting in the shower<br />
With water rolling down my skin<br />
My wet hair drops down like snakes on my head.<br />
First one, then two, then the whole family<br />
My shaky exhale stumbles out into the air<br />
As my cold, dormant heart fills up with dread.</p>

<p>Sighing in the shower<br />
As my snake family begins to speak<br />
All the words that I find I’m afraid of.<br />
First one, then two, the the whole family<br />
Each spitting out scalding insults I try to escape from<br />
As tears stream out like the warm water above.</p>

<p>Crying in the shower<br />
The snakes screaming louder<br />
My thoughts starting to whirl and my mind beginning to swirl<br />
“You’ll never be as good as him”<br />
“Your choices will never get you anywhere”<br />
“The people you trust will betray one once more”</p>

<p>“They wanted a boy, not a girl”</p>

<p>Turning off the shower<br />
Snakes spitting out their last drops of water<br />
I take my towel and rub the tears from my eyes.<br />
As I stand before the mirror<br />
And comb my wet hair<br />
I say goodbye to my snake family of lies.</p>
