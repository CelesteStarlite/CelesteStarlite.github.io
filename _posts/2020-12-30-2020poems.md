## Snakes in the Shower ##
A poem about negative voices

Turning on the shower\\
Warm water spilling out onto the floor\\
A lengthy sigh escapes into the scalding steam.\\
In rhythmic tapping of drops on my back\\
My eyes softly close as steam encircles me,\\
And I sink to the floor underneath the water stream.

Sitting in the shower\\
With water rolling down my skin\\
My wet hair drops down like snakes on my head.\\
First one, then two, then the whole family\\
My shaky exhale stumbles out into the air\\
As my cold, dormant heart fills up with dread.

Sighing in the shower\\
As my snake family begins to speak\\
All the words that I find I’m afraid of.\\
First one, then two, the the whole family\\
Each spitting out scalding insults I try to escape from\\
As tears stream out like the warm water above.

Crying in the shower\\
The snakes screaming louder\\
My thoughts starting to whirl and my mind beginning to swirl\\
“You’ll never be as good as him”\\
“Your choices will never get you anywhere”\\
“The people you trust will betray one once more”

“They wanted a boy, not a girl”

Turning off the shower\\
Snakes spitting out their last drops of water\\
I take my towel and rub the tears from my eyes.\\
As I stand before the mirror\\
And comb my wet hair\\
I say goodbye to my snake family of lies.
