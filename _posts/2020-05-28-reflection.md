Dear Celeste,

Or, you, specifically. Who knows where you’ll go and what your name will be. We both know what we know, so there’s no reason to dawdle. You called me here to assist with that reflection, didn’t you? We have one more assignment to do and close this out. So, let’s begin.

But before that, I think it’s important to recognize how far you’ve come. Not just from starting this blog, but back all the way in 2020 when you first hit that go live button. When you first began to put yourself out there. You’ve become so much more since then. You’ve weaved stories, created memories, and discovered new parts of yourself. I know you haven’t figured it all out yet, and that’s ok. You’ve taken so many more steps forwards this past year, and I’m certain you’ll keep taking strides forwards. You’ve met great people. Swiss, Mana, Evie, Suga, all people who’ve called you a friend. People who helped you feel accepted for who you are. You’ve put more effort into personal projects than you ever have for classes. You’ve done so, so much.

We both know this isn’t the end of your development. It isn’t the end of streaming, writing, or creating. But this is an amazing beginning. And I’ll be here as you keep moving forwards.

Now, let’s look at your writing.

You started with just some of the revised prose or short stories you made years ago. They’re fine, I suppose. But you know what I’m going to say about your poems. You focus on a specific gimmick or technique, letting it cover your poem while the rest of it suffers as a result. And I can tell you noticed, and you changed it. Snakes in the Shower was a perfect response to those, creating a poem that simply exists as a series of lines that each worked in harmony without any extravagant techniques. You learned, you adapted, and you made improvements.

Then there were the analysis pages, which you had your fun with. I know how hard it is to bring that specific format together to talk about the songs you wanted, but I believe you did well. You brought your schoolwork and passions together in one fell swoop, and made some paragraphs that I would say are worth reading. Although, I’d recommend you revisit them. You have so much more to say when you aren’t as worried about format, so explain it more freely when you return to it.

But I can tell the real strides you’ve made come from my stories. The writing you’ve done monthly (well almost monthly) since July. You’ve been great at doing dedicated stories, telling a narrative using tons of disconnected stories. You improved on your narrator’s voice, making the way a character speaks and acts part of the story. The reader finds a better way to connect to the speaker, like their listening to a conversation. Of course, there are more aspects of the balance of a story you need to master. Balancing descriptions with progress, allowing the story to move as fast as it should in accordance to the event. Plus, well, you need to still get better at being on time. I’m sure you’ll get better at that.

Your streaming has been fantastic as well, but you don’t need me to tell you that. You’ve come a long way and I know every day, you find time to be grateful in your heart for the community you’ve cultivated. Your video is great too, and I hope your work with editing keeps moving forward.

Your skills overall have improved greatly. You’ve become a better writer and a better speaker. You’ve learned to edit, and even so some art. Of course, you’re not at the level of an artist, per say. But you’ve gotten the work done that you needed to, like your overlay. Just about every aspect of you has improved, not just in this last year but in your entire time in high school. I’m proud of you.

I know you’re scared of college. I know you’re scared of the future. I know you’re scared you won’t discover who you are until it’s too late. But I also know that you’ve got everything you need to make it through. Remember: Always keep improving. Always keep moving forward. And everything is going to be ok.

Sincerely,

Celeste S.
